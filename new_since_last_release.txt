major changes: indexing and netCDF I/O were rewritten from the bottom up
- indexing: now uses numpy.searchsorted (with prior sorting of arrays) when more than element is searched.
==> much shorter source code, and just a factor 2 slower than pandas re-indexing
==> no dependency on pandas anymore
- slicing : specific behaviour on ordered numerical axes, to slice in-between two axis values
- netCDF I/O: DatasetOnDisk allows exploring a netCDF Dataset on disk without loading it, with the Dataset/DimArray representation and indexing conventions for loading. It is more complete wrapper around netCDF4-python, returning a DimArray instead of numpy array. Underlying netCDF4 object is accessible to the user if other low-level 
operations are required.
- convergence toward xray/pandas API:
introduction of iloc, loc, sel, isel
- also introduction of nloc for nearest neighbor indexing
- removed : `aggregate`
- renamed align_axes into align, add "join=" parameter "inner" or "outer"
- group and ungroup renamed as flatten and unflatten, GroupedAxis as MultiAxis
