Numpy array with dimensions
---------------------------
dimarray is a package to handle numpy arrays with labelled dimensions and axes. 
Inspired from pandas, it includes advanced alignment and reshaping features and 
as well as missing-value (NaN) handling.

The main difference with pandas is that it is generalized to N dimensions, and behaves more closely to a numpy array. 
The axes do not have fixed names ('index', 'columns', etc...) but are 
given a meaningful name by the user (e.g. 'time', 'items', 'lon' ...). 
This is especially useful for high dimensional problems such as sensitivity analyses.

A natural I/O format for such an array is netCDF, common in geophysics, which relies on 
the netCDF4 package, and supports metadata.

Getting started
---------------

A **``DimArray``** can be defined just like a numpy array, with
additional information about its dimensions, which can be provided
via its `axes` and `dims` parameters:

>>> from dimarray import DimArray
>>> a = DimArray([[1.,2,3], [4,5,6]], axes=[['a', 'b'], [1950, 1960, 1970]], dims=['variable', 'time']) 
>>> a
dimarray: 6 non-null elements (0 null)
0 / variable (2): 'a' to 'b'
1 / time (3): 1950 to 1970
array([[1., 2., 3.],
       [4., 5., 6.]])

Indexing now works on axes

>>> a['b', 1970]
6.0

Or can just be done **a la numpy**, via integer index:

>>> a.ix[0, -1]
3.0

Basic numpy transformations are also in there:

>>> a.mean(axis='time')
dimarray: 2 non-null elements (0 null)
0 / variable (2): 'a' to 'b'
array([2., 5.])

Can export to `pandas` for pretty printing:

>>> a.to_pandas()
time      1950  1960  1970
variable                  
a          1.0   2.0   3.0
b          4.0   5.0   6.0

Install
-------

**Requirements**:

- python >= 2.7, 3
- numpy (tested with 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10.1, 1.15)

**Optional**:

- netCDF4 (tested with 1.0.8, 1.2.1) (netCDF archiving) (see notes below)
- matplotlib 1.1 (plotting)
- pandas 0.11 (interface with pandas)

Download the latest version from github and extract from archive
Then from the dimarray repository type (possibly preceded by sudo):

.. code:: bash
    
    python setup.py install  

Alternatively, you can use pip to download and install the version from pypi (could be slightly out-of-date):

.. code:: bash

    pip install dimarray 


Notes on installing netCDF4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- On Ubuntu, using apt-get is the easiest way (as indicated at https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf4-python/blob/master/.travis.yml):


.. code:: bash

   sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev netcdf-bin libnetcdf-dev

- On windows binaries are available: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/winbin.html

- From source. Installing the netCDF4 python module from source can be cumbersome, because 
  it depends on netCDF4 and (especially) HDF5 C libraries that need to 
  be compiled with specific flags (http://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python).
