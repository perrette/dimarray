==========================================
dimarray: Array with meaningful dimensions
==========================================

Planned Features
----------------

* numpy's ndarrays with named axes and metadata organized on the netCDF format
* follow pandas' api but works for any dimension and any axis name
* includes most numpy transformations
* alias method for matplotlib plotting.
* natural netCDF I/O

* main classes and functions:

    * Dimarray		    : main class (a meta-class containing ndarray in the values field)
    * Dataset		    : collections.OrderedDict of Dimarray objects
    * Axes, Axis	    : axis and indexing
    * read, write, summary  : netCDF I/O

Architecture: a genealogy of array
----------------------------------

basearray => nanarray => laxarray => dimarray

basearray: just emulate a numpy array
           + introduce the xs method (only one axis)
	   + `==` operator returns a boolean and not an array
	   recent update: axis is None by default like in numpy

nanarray : treats nans as missing values

laxarray : add a name to each dimension 
	   + can give an axis name to `axis=`
	   + multidimensional slicing
	   + recursive `endomorphic` transformation on subsets of the whole space

dimarray : add values and metadata to each axis and to the array
	   + netCDF I/O
