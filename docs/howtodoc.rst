Maintainance of the documentation
=================================

The Documentation is generated with Sphinx from ReStructuredTxt files ('.rst'). 
Many sections however also exist and are maintained as notebooks, using basic formatting 
rules common to ReStructuredTxt and MarkDown. A script is used to convert these
notebooks to the ReStructuredTxt format understood by Sphinx.
